This project is an example shooter game which uses the [SpatialOS GDK for Unreal](https://github.com/spatialos/unrealGDK). 

The project contains gameplay and assets that are representative of a basic first-person shooter running on SpatialOS. If you want to make your own project from scratch, use the [Starter Template](https://docs.improbable.io/unreal/alpha/content/get-started/gdk-template).

For setup instructions, follow the [Example Project guide](https://docs.improbable.io/unreal/latest/content/get-started/example-project/exampleproject-intro)  in the GDK for Unreal documentation. 

For more information, see the [SpatialOS GDK for Unreal documentation](https://docs.improbable.io/unreal/latest/).

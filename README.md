The SpatialOS Game Development Kit (GDK) for Unreal is an Unreal Engine fork and plugin with associated projects. It gives you the features of [SpatialOS](https://spatialos.improbable.io/docs/reference/latest), within the familiar workflows and APIs of Unreal Engine. For more information, please see the GDK's [documentation website](https://docs.improbable.io/unreal/latest).

> The SpatialOS GDK for Unreal is in alpha. It is ready to use for development of single-server games, but not recommended for public releases. We are committed to rapid development of the GDK to provide a performant release - for information on this, see our [development roadmap](https://github.com/spatialos/UnrealGDK/projects/1) and [Unreal features support](https://docs.improbable.io/unreal/latest/unreal-features-support) pages, and contact us via our forums, or on Discord.

This is the repository for the Example Project, an example shooter game that uses the GDK.

In addition to the Example Project, the GDK also contains:
 
* [The SpatialOS Unreal Engine fork](https://github.com/improbableio/UnrealEngine)

    You must be a member of the [Epic Games organization](https://github.com/EpicGames) on GitHub to access this. If you aren't, the link returns a 404 error.
* [The GDK plugin](https://github.com/spatialos/UnrealGDK)

## About the Example Project 
The Example Project contains gameplay and assets that are representative of a basic first-person shooter running on SpatialOS. If you want to make your own project from scratch, use the Starter Template by following the [Starter Template guide](https://docs.improbable.io/unreal/alpha/content/get-started/gdk-template) in the GDK for Unreal documentation.

For setup instructions, follow the [Example Project guide](https://docs.improbable.io/unreal/latest/content/get-started/example-project/exampleproject-intro)  in the GDK for Unreal documentation. 

For more information, see the [SpatialOS GDK for Unreal documentation](https://docs.improbable.io/unreal/latest/).

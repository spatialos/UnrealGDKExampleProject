rem To launch a local Spatial deployment with a different launch configuration, change the default_launch.json argument to the name of your configuration file, 
rem for example one_worker_test.json or two_worker_test.json. Similarly, you can specify a different snapshot than the default one by replacing the value of 
rem the --snapshot argument with the path to the snapshot you want to launch with.
